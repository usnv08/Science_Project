<h1 align="left">b).Represent symbolically the practices you and you famlily have started for this with these Rs</h1>
<h2 align="left">Ans. the practices which me and my family have started for this with the three Rs are:
<ul>
<li>We have been segregating the dry and the wet waste. In which the dry waste can get reused and the wet waste can be recycled and be used as a compost for the plants.</li>
<align="right"><img src="C:\Users\ub_nu\Desktop\Vaishu web page\wet and dry waste.jpg"height="350"width="400"</right>
<li> we have only been using cloth bags instead of plastic bags to help the environment.</li></h2>
<h1 align="left">c).Represent symbolically the practices what you and your family wishes to achieve this year to help the environment.</h1>
<h2 align="left">Ans. The practices which me and my family wishes to achieve this year are to recycle our waste, dispose our waste properly and also reuse things. them.</h2>

<h1 align="left">d).Represent symbolically the practices that you feel are important to protect the
environment and why you cannot achieve them now.</h1>
<h2 align="left">Ans. The practices that i feel are important to protect the environment is that i want to dispose the COVID essentials to be diposed correctly, but we cannot acheive that now because we dont have such efficient methods to convert the COVID waste into something useful or disposing it properly. </h2>

<h1 align="left">1).How are masks, PP kits and face shields made?</h1>
<h2 align="left"><font color="Red">Ans. Masks are made on a machine line that assembles the nonwovens from bobbins, ultrasonically welds the layers together, and stamps the masks with nose strips, ear loops, and other pieces, whereas Coveralls and body suits are made from nonwovens and laminates with varying levels of resistance to permeation, penetration, and degradation by hazardous substances.</font></h2>

<h1 align="left">2.) What happens when they are disposed in bins?</h1>
<h2 align="left"><font color="Red">Ans. PPEs are vital in battling the COVID-19 crisis, but need to be disposed daily, especially by healthcare workers. This waste is slowly piling up an environmental crisis.Masks, gloves and PPEs have been found dumped outside the hospitals or even on the roads. There is no segregation happening at the household level. Waste collectors have to sort it, and in doing so are directly exposed to the potentially infected material. And the collectors reside in congested and densely populated places. In case they are asymptomatic or infected, they will pass the virus onto others.</font></h2>

<h1 align="left">3.) Is it contributing to pollution?</h1>
<h2 align="left"><font color="red">Ans. Yes, Without better disposal practices, an environmental disaster is looming. The majority of masks are manufactured from long-lasting plastic materials, and if discarded can persist in the environment for decades to hundreds of years. This means they can have a number of impacts on the environment and people</font></h2>
<h1 align="left"><font face="Leelawadee UI"color="693c72"><U>But we can take care of this problem by:</U></font>
<font face="Forte"color="f14668"><ol>
<li>remove the mask by using appropriate technique</li>
<li>after removal or whenever you inadvertently touch a used mask, clean hands by using a hand sanitizer or with soap.</li>
<li>do not re-use single-use masks</li>
<li>discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removal.</li>
<li> We can use cloth masks which can be REUSED which decreases the pollution caused by the.</li>
<li>We all should RETHINK before disposing this waste</li>
